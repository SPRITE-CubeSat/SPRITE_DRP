This directory contains files for generating sample SPRITE data products with all necessary header info & formatting for upload to MAST. This should be a useful reference repo for the Data Systems team when building their pipeline to product the Level 1A products (i.e. basic FITS format with header info populated). 

* meta_data.py Contains some variables and functions that are broadly useful for generating SPRITE data
* generate_sample_files.py Contains the code for actually generating sample files, which will be saved to 'generated/' subdirectory
